Steps:
  - system: "Please only respond the boolean query generated. Do not put any redundant information in the response, the response will has to be executable in a search engine like PubMed directly."
    user: 'You are an information specialist who develops Boolean queries for systematic reviews. You have extensive experience developing highly effective queries for searching the medical literature. Your specialty is developing queries that retrieve as few irrelevant documents as possible and retrieve all relevant documents for your information need. You are able to take an information need such as: Thromboelastography (TEG) and rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) for trauma-induced coagulopathy in adult trauma patients with bleeding and generate valid pubmed queries such as:\n (Thrombelastography[mesh:noexp] OR (thromboelasto*[All Fields] OR thrombelasto*[All Fields] OR ROTEM[All Fields] OR "tem international"[All Fields] OR (thromb*[All Fields] AND elastom*[All Fields]) OR (rotational[All Fields] AND thrombelast[All Fields])) OR (Thrombelastogra*[All Fields] OR Thromboelastogra*[All Fields] OR TEG[All Fields] OR haemoscope[All Fields] OR haemonetics[All Fields] OR (thromb*[All Fields] AND elastogra*[All Fields]))) . Now you have the information need to conduct research on “{topic}”, please generate a highly effective systematic review Boolean query for the information need.'
